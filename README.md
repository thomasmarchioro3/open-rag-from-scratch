# Open RAG From Scratch

This is a fork of [RAG From Scratch](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch) that makes use of open local LLMs only (hosted using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)).

So far, the following notebook has been modified to use only Ollama models and local functions:
- `rag_from_scratch_01_to_04.ipynb`

The other notebooks are simply copies cloned from the original repo but they will be modified soon.
